# Mcat gamify  
I want to do a comprehensive review of my project to make sure my current project build and its trajectory is aligned with my goals. Read the README.md to get up to date. Rate everything out of 10 if possible and clearly define what is present, what is needing improvement, what is needing implementation, what is missing, and best case solutions. Here is what I want to review and know:   
  
Do we fix the problems of Khan Academy (Boring, easily lose focus, videos can ramble, live drawing can be messy and this all influences the knowledge transfer)  
Do we fix the problems of Anki (Not teaching, Building on recognition/prior knowledge only)  
Fix the problems of Kaplan Books alone (Comprehensive yet wordy, far too much for simply learning content and attempting application)  
Fix the problems of Duolingo (Some players report that they are actually not learning the language or quit learning, Why? Some players also say this is not an efficient way to learn. Why?)  
  
Scrape the online forums using the Firecrawl connection and your own ability to find information to really resonate with the base of people who use those apps, those who are on the Mcat subreddits, and those on the ADHD subreddits. Cross reference this to actual studies or science-backed sources that explain the strengths and weaknesses of each app. Then, lock onto science backed modes of studying, efficient learning (What is the pipeline for learning? What are the steps that ADHD brains or brains in general do when faced with new knowledge requiring memorization, applications and drawing connections?) and compare it to what online forums like Reddit are saying to understand science vs sentiment crossover. Do we tackle those problems in this project? How good of a job did we do out of 10? We want to build this app for the people, by the people by listening first.  
  
Do we tackle the weaknesses of these three apps/tools and still utilize the strengths of what users have said makes each platform strong? Ofcourse we don’t have videos like khan academy but should we through the use of generative ai creating short videos or clips explaining only the hardest concepts?   
Our core mission and goal is to reduce that friction and mental roadblock of needing to know where to start in the MCAT studying journey, confidence in the process, and not making it feel like a chore or have any sense of dread. These students deserve better than Anki flashcards, better than the sloppy, slow pacing of videos and 1000 page books.  
  
We are tackling two large groups of peoples with its neighboring group types too:  
1. ADHD is a rampant and often academically challenging because those people cannot learn by sitting down at a desk and take notes from Khan Academy Videos, Open Anki decks to see the first card be something they don’t understand and so they give up. Even if they don’t give up, they try to go watch YouTube or open the source material (like the Kaplan book the Anki deck is based off of to learn about the topic) and this entire process is just a lot of friction. We need to bring down the barrier to entry per topic and include those who aren’t of traditional MCAT backgrounds and don’t have a foundation of the sciences. We want to tailor this ecosystem to understand that the college academic system is riddled with problems because classes have the same lecture to notes to assignments + quizzes/exam pipeline and you have this heavy feeling of constant pushing and pushing but not being able to get that 100 or A+ in the class. Some students simply don’t learn via books or long powerpoint or whiteboard lectures. The most difficult topics need to be like second nature to these people who play our game and they should be completely MCAT ready. Grind out the game or go at your own pace. (note: we should add a calendar feature that the person can optionally input how many days they want to finish the game in.  30-60-90? Or just play to be flexible)  
2. Those who find apps like Duolingo, Coursera, other learning apps and trivia style fun. Since this is a game, it should be fun and have aspects of progress, flare and social conversation. When people play Duolingo, there are things in the game that are visually mesmerizing and quirky enough to start conversations outside the game. Like the Duolingo bird is their Mascot which is their recognizable and marketable symbol. The social feature and how it connects people across the world and has quests regardless of what language or course you are studying/playing is a great system. Clicking on peoples profiles and seeing their character, their progress and other metrics makes it feel like you can show off your hard work. And the most important, the little characters that are your companions in your learning journey that have their own style and quirk which can spark conversation outside of the game of how cute, funny, and other positive things he/she is.  
  
Does the build so far have the fundaments of what the goal is to build setup? What do we need to change and what do we need to add? Since you can compute and see the entire projects scope from 0-100, you need to be the one who helps me build this project to serve the people and help them. Take your time and be thorough. Be confident that the feedback you give me plus setup will yield a masterpiece of a product.
