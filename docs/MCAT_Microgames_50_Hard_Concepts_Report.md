# MCAT Mastery — 50 Hard Concepts as 30–60s Cozy Micro-Games

This report turns each hard concept into a **tiny interactive verification game** designed for fast recall, low friction, and strong visual feedback.

## Design Constraints Used
- Session length: **30–60 seconds** each
- Interaction type: drag/drop, tap/select, quick sliders, path tracing, mini-sorts
- Outcome: verify understanding, not full teaching
- Tone: cozy, playful, non-punishing, high feedback

## Reusable Micro-Game Template (for implementation)
- **Prompt (3–5s):** LYRA gives a 1-line mission objective.
- **Play (20–40s):** 1 focused interaction loop.
- **Check (5–10s):** instant correctness + short explanation.
- **Reward (2–5s):** tile clear, sparkle, crystal gain, streak progress.

## Fast Implementation Patterns (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Mini-engine:** one reusable `MicroGameShell` with timer, prompt, interaction area, and result panel.
- **Input widgets:** drag/drop API, sliders, clickable hotspots, card sorting.
- **Feedback:** instant green/red pulse, LYRA one-liners, tiny explanation chip.
- **Scoring:** binary pass + confidence stars (1–3) + retry with new seed.
- **Replayability:** randomize labels, values, and distractors per attempt.

## Cozy UX Notes
- Short gentle audio cues, no harsh fail sounds.
- "Partial recall" language instead of "wrong".
- Warm micro-animations (sparkles, glow, soft easing).
- Always offer **"Try Similar"** instead of punitive restart.
