You are cataloging all figures and diagrams in Chapter {chapter_number}: {chapter_title} of this Kaplan MCAT textbook.

For EACH figure/diagram in this chapter, provide:
- figure_id: The figure number exactly as printed (e.g., "1.9", "2.3")
- title: The figure caption/title exactly as written in the book
- page: The page number where this figure appears
- section_id: Which section (e.g., "1.2") this figure is associated with
- description: A DETAILED description of what the figure shows:
  * For labeled diagrams: list all labels and what they point to
  * For graphs: describe axes, curves, key data points
  * For flowcharts: describe the flow and all boxes/steps
  * For structures: describe the components and their arrangement
  * For tables presented as figures: extract all data
- content_tags: Key concepts this figure illustrates (array of strings)
- figure_type: One of: "diagram" | "graph" | "table_figure" | "flowchart" | "structure" | "illustration" | "chart"

Parietal lobe (yellow) at the top-back, labeled 'touch, temperature, and pain'. Temporal lobe (green) at the side-bottom, labeled 'hearing'. Occipital lobe (red) at the back, labeled 'vision'. The boundary between frontal and parietal shows 'primary motor cortex' (anterior) and 'primary somatosensory cortex' (posterior).",

RULES:
- Catalog EVERY figure in the chapter. Do not skip any.
- Descriptions should be detailed enough that someone who cannot see the image understands its content.
- For labeled diagrams: list EVERY label visible in the figure.
- For graphs: describe what each axis represents and any notable trends or data points.
- Set total_figures to the actual count.
