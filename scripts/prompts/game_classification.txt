GAME TYPE DEFINITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"build" — Put steps of a process in the correct order (drag-and-drop sequencing)
  Trigger: numbered_steps with 4+ steps, or any described process/pathway

"label" — Identify and label parts of a structure or diagram (tap-to-label)
  Trigger: figure with 4+ labeled parts, or a labeled diagram description

"enzyme" — Match enzymes/molecules to their functions or targets (drag-to-match)
  Trigger: comparison_table or fill_in_table with enzyme-function mappings

"regulate" — Apply correct inhibitors/activators to targets and predict effects
  Trigger: content mentioning regulatory molecules, feedback loops, or pathway control

"match" — Drag properties to the correct category in a comparison (column sorting)
  Trigger: comparison_table with 3+ rows comparing 2+ items

"equation" — See equation name → pick the formula, or see formula → identify variables
  Trigger: equations_to_remember entries

"rapid_recall" — Flash a term, pick the correct definition from 4 options (5-sec timer)
  Trigger: 5+ definitions in the section, or a long bullet_list of categorized items

"diagram_label" — Tap regions of an image to label them correctly
  Trigger: illustration or structure figure with distinct labeled regions

REPETITION PRIORITY RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Mark as "critical" if the content is ANY of these high-yield memorization topics:
- Metabolic pathways (glycolysis, TCA/Krebs, ETC, gluconeogenesis, beta-oxidation, pentose phosphate, urea cycle, fatty acid synthesis)
- Amino acid properties and classifications (polar, nonpolar, charged, special)
- Organic chemistry functional groups
- Brain regions and their functions
- Enzyme classifications and mechanisms
- Hormones and their target organs/effects
- Autonomic nervous system effects (sympathetic vs parasympathetic)
- Kidney nephron segments and their functions
- Immune cell types and their roles
- Cardiac cycle and heart anatomy
- Key physics equations and when to use each
- Acid-base chemistry (pKa, Henderson-Hasselbalch)
- Genetic code / codon table usage
- Cell cycle phases and checkpoints
- Sensory organ structures (eye, ear)
- Muscle contraction mechanism

Mark as "important" if it involves structured memorization but isn't in the critical list.
Mark as "supplementary" if the content is more conceptual understanding than pure memorization.

RULES:
- If there is NO structured/ordered/labeled content suitable for games → set has_games to false and games to empty array []
- Each game must have at least 4 items to be worthwhile
- Include 1-2 distractors (plausible-sounding wrong items) for build and label games
- Only include regulators if the content actually mentions regulatory molecules
- game_title should be concise: "Build: Glycolysis" or "Label: Brain Lobes" or "Match: Prokaryote vs Eukaryote"
- Difficulty 1 = 4-5 items, Difficulty 2 = 6-8 items, Difficulty 3 = 9+ items
