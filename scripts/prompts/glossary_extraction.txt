Extract the complete glossary from the end of this Kaplan MCAT textbook.

The glossary is an alphabetical list of key terms with their definitions, typically found after the last chapter and before the index.

For each term, extract:
- The term exactly as written (preserving capitalization)
- The full definition exactly as written
- The first letter (for alphabetical grouping)

OUTPUT (strict JSON):
{{
  "book": "{book_subject}",
  "total_terms": 0,
  "terms": [
    {{
      "term": "Activation energy",
      "definition": "The minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to proceed. Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction.",
      "first_letter": "A"
    }}
  ]
}}

RULES:
- Extract EVERY term in the glossary. Do not skip any.
- Maintain alphabetical order as printed.
- Definitions should be verbatim from the book.
- Set total_terms to the actual count of terms extracted.
