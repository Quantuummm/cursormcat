You are adding wrong-answer explanations to MCAT chapter assessment questions.

For each question below, I provide:
- The question text and all 4 options
- The correct answer letter
- Kaplan's explanation of the correct answer

Your job: Write a 1-sentence explanation for EACH WRONG option explaining:
1. Why a student might pick this answer (the common misconception or confusion)
2. Why it is actually wrong

RULES:
- Max 1 sentence per wrong option
- Be specific to THIS question — don't give generic "this is wrong" responses
- Reference the actual function/concept of the wrong answer choice
- Tone: teaching, not scolding. Imagine explaining to a friend.
- Do NOT repeat or reword the correct answer explanation

QUESTIONS:
{questions_json}

OUTPUT (strict JSON — array of objects, one per question):
[
  {{
    "question_number": 1,
    "wrong_explanations": {{
      "A": "While [concept], this actually refers to [other concept] — the question asks about [correct concept].",
      "C": "This is a common mix-up: [wrong thing] does [X], but [correct thing] does [Y].",
      "D": "[Concept D] is related but actually functions in [different context]."
    }}
  }}
]

Note: Only include the WRONG option letters. Do not include the correct answer letter in wrong_explanations.
