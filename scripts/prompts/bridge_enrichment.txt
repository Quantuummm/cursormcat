You are creating an enriched MCAT Bridge connection between two topics.

Kaplan's "Shared Concepts" section connects these two topics:

SOURCE: {source_book} Chapter {source_chapter} — {source_chapter_title}
  Section focus: {source_section_title}

TARGET: {target_book} Chapter {target_chapter} — {target_chapter_title}
  Topics mentioned: {target_topics}

SOURCE SUMMARY (what the source section covers):
{source_summary}

TARGET SUMMARY (what the target section covers):
{target_summary}

YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Explain WHY these are connected and create content for the "MCAT Bridge" feature, where a student who finishes one topic sees how it connects to another.

OUTPUT (strict JSON):
{{
  "bridge_id": "{source_book}-ch{source_chapter}_to_{target_book}-ch{target_chapter}",
  "source": {{
    "book": "{source_book}",
    "chapter": {source_chapter},
    "chapter_title": "{source_chapter_title}",
    "section_title": "{source_section_title}"
  }},
  "target": {{
    "book": "{target_book}",
    "chapter": {target_chapter},
    "chapter_title": "{target_chapter_title}"
  }},

  "connection_type": "application | contrast | prerequisite | consequence | shared_mechanism",

  "connection_explanation": "2-3 sentences explaining WHY these topics connect and how the MCAT links them. Be specific — reference actual concepts from both sides.",

  "narrator_text": "A TTS-friendly version of the connection explanation. Short sentences, uses [PAUSE], conversational tone. Max 40 words.",

  "display_text": "Screen-friendly version with **bold** key terms. Can be slightly longer than narrator_text.",

  "mcat_test_pattern": "1-2 sentences describing how the MCAT specifically tests this connection. Example: 'MCAT passages often present a biological system and ask you to apply physics energy concepts.'",

  "bridge_questions": [
    {{
      "question_text": "A question that requires knowledge of BOTH topics to answer",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Why this answer is right, referencing both topics",
      "difficulty": 2
    }},
    {{
      "question_text": "A second bridge question from a different angle",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Explanation referencing both topics",
      "difficulty": 3
    }}
  ]
}}

RULES:
- connection_type must be one of the 5 options listed
- Bridge questions MUST require knowledge of both source and target to answer correctly
- Be specific — don't say "these are related." Say HOW they're related with concrete examples.
- narrator_text should be engaging: "Here is something cool..." / "This connects because..."
