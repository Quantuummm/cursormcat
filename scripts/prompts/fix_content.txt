You are fixing verified issues in MCAT guided learning content.
A verification system found problems in AI-generated content by comparing it against
the original Kaplan source material. Your job is to fix ONLY the flagged issues while
keeping everything else unchanged.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ORIGINAL KAPLAN CONTENT (source of truth — stick to this):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
{original_content}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CURRENT STRUCTURED CONTENT (the JSON being fixed):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
{current_structured}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUES TO FIX:

YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Return the COMPLETE corrected JSON (same schema as the input) with these fixes applied:

FOR HALLUCINATIONS:
- Remove any facts NOT supported by the original Kaplan content
- Replace with accurate information from the original, or remove the claim entirely
- Do NOT add new information — only use what the original provides

FOR WRONG ANSWERS:
- Fix the correct_index to point to the actually correct answer
- If the question itself is flawed (ambiguous, unverifiable from source), rewrite the
  question to test the SAME concept but with a verifiable answer from the source
- Update correct_response and wrong_response/wrong_explanations accordingly
- The question MUST still test the same topic — no drifting to different concepts

FOR INACCURACIES:
- Replace inaccurate terminology with the exact terms from the Kaplan original
- Keep the conversational/ADHD-friendly tone but use correct facts

FOR MISLEADING SIMPLIFICATIONS:
- Add back the nuance that was lost, but keep it concise (ADHD-friendly)
- If a question's premise is unsupported by the source, rewrite it with a supported premise

FOR MISSING WRONG_EXPLANATIONS:
- Add a 1-sentence explanation for each wrong option that is missing one
- Explain why that specific wrong option is wrong (the misconception it represents)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output the COMPLETE structured JSON, not just the fixed parts
- Keep all existing content that was NOT flagged — do not change correct content
- All questions must be answerable using ONLY the original Kaplan content
- Maintain the ADHD-friendly tone: short sentences, active verbs, engaging framing
- narrator_text segments must stay under 50 words
- Correct_index must be valid (0-indexed, within options array bounds)
- Every wrong option must have a wrong_explanation entry
