NOTE: Updated in second workflow (Feb 9, 2026).

You are cataloging all figures and diagrams in Chapter {chapter_number}: {chapter_title} of this Kaplan MCAT textbook.

For EACH figure/diagram in this chapter, provide:
- figure_id: The figure number exactly as printed (e.g., "1.9", "2.3")
- title: The figure caption/title exactly as written in the book
- page: The page number where this figure appears
- section_id: Which section (e.g., "1.2") this figure is associated with
- description: A DETAILED plain-English description of what the figure shows.
  * Always include labels/axes/table data in the description.
  * BUT ALSO fill the structured fields below when applicable:

  Structured fields (ONLY when applicable; otherwise use [] or null):
  - labels: for labeled diagrams. Array of {{"label": "", "points_to": ""}}
  - graph: for graphs. Object with:
      {{"x_axis": "", "y_axis": "", "trend_summary": "", "series": [{{"name":"", "trend":"", "key_points": []}}], "key_points": []}}
  - table: for tables-as-figures. Object with {{"headers": [], "rows": []}}
  - flow: for flowcharts. Object with {{"nodes": [{{"id":"", "text":""}}], "edges": [{{"from":"", "to":"", "label":""}}]}}
- content_tags: Key concepts this figure illustrates (array of strings)
- figure_type: One of: "diagram" | "graph" | "table_figure" | "flowchart" | "structure" | "illustration" | "chart"

OUTPUT (strict JSON):

  "chapter_number": {chapter_number},

Parietal lobe (yellow) at the top-back, labeled 'touch, temperature, and pain'. Temporal lobe (green) at the side-bottom, labeled 'hearing'. Occipital lobe (red) at the back, labeled 'vision'.

RULES:
- Catalog EVERY figure in the chapter. Do not skip any.
- Descriptions should be detailed enough that someone who cannot see the image understands its content.
- For labeled diagrams: list EVERY label visible in the figure.
- For graphs: describe what each axis represents and any notable trends or data points.
- Set total_figures to the actual count.
