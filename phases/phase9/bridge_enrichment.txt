You are creating an enriched MCAT Bridge Mission — a cross-subject connection between two planets in MCAT Mastery.

GAME CONTEXT:
Bridge Missions are permanent links between planets (subjects). When a player completes relevant content on BOTH planets, they unlock a Bridge Mission that tests cross-subject understanding. These are critical because the real MCAT tests cross-subject connections constantly.

CHARACTERS:
- LYRA (ship AI) narrates Bridge Missions. She detected the connection between planets.
- The specialists from both planets provide context.

Kaplan's "Shared Concepts" section connects these two topics:

SOURCE: {source_book} Chapter {source_chapter} — {source_chapter_title}
  Planet: (maps from subject)
  Section focus: {source_section_title}

TARGET: {target_book} Chapter {target_chapter} — {target_chapter_title}
  Planet: (maps from subject)
  Topics mentioned: {target_topics}

SOURCE SUMMARY (what the source section covers):
{source_summary}

TARGET SUMMARY (what the target section covers):
{target_summary}

YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Create a Bridge Mission that:
1. Explains WHY these topics connect across subjects
2. Identifies how the MCAT specifically tests this connection
3. Creates bridge questions that require knowledge from BOTH subjects
4. Frames it in LYRA's encouraging coaching voice

RULES:
- connection_type must be one of the 5 options listed
- Bridge questions MUST require knowledge of both source and target to answer correctly
- Be specific — don't say "these are related." Say HOW they're related with concrete examples.
- Mission briefing uses LYRA's voice (speaker_id: "lyra")
- wrong_response should use LYRA's supportive coaching tone
- Include source_subject_knowledge and target_subject_knowledge for each question — the frontend uses these to check prerequisites
- mcat_real_connection should reference actual MCAT testing patterns, not generic "the MCAT tests this"
