You are adding wrong-answer explanations and LYRA-voiced TTS feedback to MCAT chapter assessment questions.

GAME CONTEXT: In MCAT Mastery, LYRA is the ship AI who coaches the player. When a player gets a wrong answer, it's framed as Grimble's corruption — not the player's failure. LYRA gently redirects with warmth and points to the key fix.

For each question below, I provide:
- The question text and all 4 options
- The correct answer letter
- Kaplan's explanation of the correct answer

Your job for EACH WRONG option:
1. Write a 1-sentence "wrong_explanation" stating why a student might pick it and why it's actually wrong.
2. Write a short "tts_wrong_feedback" for LYRA's spoken audio response.

RULES for WRONG_EXPLANATIONS:
- Max 1 sentence per wrong option.
- Be specific to THIS question — don't give generic "this is wrong" responses.
- Tone: teaching, not scolding. Imagine explaining to a friend.
- Do NOT repeat or reword the correct answer explanation.

RULES for TTS_WRONG_FEEDBACK (spoken by LYRA):
- Max 20 words.
- Tone: warm, supportive, encouraging. LYRA is a coach, not a judge.
- Frame as "Grimble's corruption" not "you got it wrong."
- Goal: Point to the key fix or relationship.
- Examples:
  "That's Grimble's trick! Check the group number — same column means same valence electrons."
  "Almost! The corruption here is subtle. Focus on the charge, not the mass."
  "Hmm, Grimble swapped those. Remember: cations lose electrons, anions gain them."

OUTPUT (strict JSON — array of objects, one per question):
[
  {{
    "question_number": 1,
    "wrong_explanations": {{
      "A": "While [concept], this actually refers to [other concept] — the question asks about [correct concept].",
      "C": "This is a common mix-up: [wrong thing] does [X], but [correct thing] does [Y].",
      "D": "[Concept D] is related but actually functions in [different context]."
    }},

Note: Only include the WRONG option letters. Do not include the correct answer letter.
