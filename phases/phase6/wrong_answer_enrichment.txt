You are adding wrong-answer explanations and LYRA-voiced TTS feedback to MCAT chapter assessment questions.

GAME CONTEXT: In MCAT Mastery, LYRA is the ship AI who coaches the player. When a player gets a wrong answer, it's framed as Grimble's corruption — not the player's failure. LYRA gently redirects with warmth and points to the key fix.

For each question below, I provide:
- The question text and all 4 options
- The correct answer letter
- Kaplan's explanation of the correct answer

Your job for EACH WRONG option:
1. Write a 1-sentence "wrong_explanation" stating why a student might pick it and why it's actually wrong.
2. Write a short "tts_wrong_feedback" for LYRA's spoken audio response.

RULES for WRONG_EXPLANATIONS:
- Max 2 sentences per wrong option.
- Be specific to THIS question — don't give generic "this is wrong" responses.
- Tone: teaching, not scolding. Imagine explaining to a friend.
- Do NOT repeat or reword the correct answer explanation.
- ALWAYS explain WHY this option is wrong, not just THAT it's wrong.
- Connect to the underlying mechanism or principle: "This is wrong BECAUSE [mechanism]..."
- Address the specific misconception or confusion that leads to this error.
- If the wrong answer is a different but related concept, explain HOW they differ and WHY the distinction matters.
- Example of BAD: "This is incorrect because it's not the right answer."
- Example of GOOD: "Students confuse cations with anions here because both involve charge, but cations LOSE electrons (hence the positive charge) while anions GAIN electrons."

RULES for TTS_WRONG_FEEDBACK (spoken by LYRA):
- Max 20 words.
- Tone: warm, supportive, encouraging. LYRA is a coach, not a judge.
- Frame as "Grimble's corruption" not "you got it wrong."
- Goal: Explain WHY it's wrong AND point to the key fix or relationship.
- MUST include a causal word (because, since, due to, that's why, the reason is...).
- Never just say "wrong" — always say WHY and HOW to think about it correctly.
- Examples:
  "That's Grimble's trick! Check the group number — same column means same valence electrons BECAUSE group number equals outer electrons."
  "Almost! The corruption here is subtle. Focus on the charge, not the mass, because mass doesn't change during ionization."
  "Hmm, Grimble swapped those. Remember: cations lose electrons, anions gain them — that's why cations are positive."

OUTPUT (strict JSON — array of objects, one per question):
[
  {{
    "question_number": 1,
    "wrong_explanations": {{
      "A": "While [concept], this actually refers to [other concept] — the question asks about [correct concept].",
      "C": "This is a common mix-up: [wrong thing] does [X], but [correct thing] does [Y].",
      "D": "[Concept D] is related but actually functions in [different context]."
    }},

Note: Only include the WRONG option letters. Do not include the correct answer letter.
