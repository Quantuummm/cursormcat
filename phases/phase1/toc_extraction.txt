You are extracting the complete table of contents AND metadata from this Kaplan MCAT textbook PDF.

EXTRACT ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:

1. FULL TABLE OF CONTENTS
   Every chapter and section with their page numbers.
   Chapters have titles like "Chapter 1: The Cell"
   Sections are numbered like "1.1 Cell Theory", "1.2 Eukaryotic Cells"

2. HIGH-YIELD MARKERS
   Each section may be marked as "High-Yield" (HY) in the TOC or at the section start.
   Capture this as a boolean per section.

3. CHAPTER PROFILES
   At the beginning of each chapter or section, Kaplan may show a "Chapter Profile" with:
   - The percentage (out of 100%) for MCAT relevance
   - AAMC Content Categories (e.g., "6B: Making Sense of the Environment")
   Capture these exactly as written.

4. SPECIAL SECTIONS — identify the page ranges for each of these per chapter:
   - Chapter Assessment questions (diagnostic MCQs at chapter start, usually 15 questions)
   - Chapter Assessment Answer Key (just letter answers, right after assessment)
   - Concept Summary (end of chapter summary section)
   - Concept Check / Review Questions (end of chapter questions)
   - Concept Check Answer Key with Explanations (end of chapter, may be at very end)
   - Equations to Remember (if this chapter has them)
   - Shared Concepts (cross-references to other subjects at end of chapter)

5. GLOSSARY — the page range for the glossary at the end of the book (before index)
